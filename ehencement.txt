			Features that we want to add

It would be nice to dramatically improve the display of the score and the design of evrything in general.
From a user point of view the design and what he sees might be the most important thing.
First it would be nice to have a real scorebord with real border that will be generated dynamically.
Same for the Dices would be much more user friendly to have a display of the Dice that look like this:
		-----
		| 4 |
		-----

Then we should implent a menu where you can start the game and change the parameter. For this we need
first to rewrite some part of the code to make it more flexible, using variable and constant to define 
things like the number of Dice, the number of round, ect.

And then finally the user input should be perfectly secured. So we will need to have a bunch of function
to check every input.
